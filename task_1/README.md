ðŸš€ CanSat GNSS Module Setup & Flight State Machine

This project demonstrates how to set up a Quectel L89HA GNSS Module with an Arduino for a CanSat mission. The code configures the GNSS to output only the required NMEA sentences, parses GPS data using the TinyGPS++ library, and implements a state machine based on altitude to track the CanSatâ€™s flight profile.

ðŸ“œ Problem Statement

Objective:
Write Arduino code to set up a Quectel L89HA GNSS Module for our CanSat to:
	1.	Receive and parse GPS data.
	2.	Print time, latitude, longitude, and MSL altitude onto the Serial Monitor in a clean format.
	3.	Configure the GNSS to only output GNRMC & GNGGA NMEA sentences (to reduce unnecessary data).
	4.	Implement a simple altitude-based state machine with the following states:

	â€¢	IDLE: CanSat is stationary on the ground.
	â€¢	ASCENT: CanSat is ascending.
	â€¢	APOGEE: CanSat has reached peak altitude.
	â€¢	DESCENT: CanSat is descending without payload deployed.
	â€¢	PAYLOAD DEPLOYED: Payload is deployed at 75% of peak altitude during descent.
	â€¢	LANDED: CanSat has landed near the ground (altitude â‰¤ 5 m).

Assumption: The CanSat has a normal flight path â€” it ascends, reaches peak altitude (apogee), then descends and lands. The initial state is IDLE.

âš¡ Features
	â€¢	Uses TinyGPS++ library for easy parsing of NMEA sentences.
	â€¢	Sends UBX configuration command to enable only GNRMC & GNGGA output.
	â€¢	Implements a state machine that transitions based on altitude changes.
	â€¢	Prints both GNSS data and current flight state to the Serial Monitor.
	â€¢	Includes a simulation option to test logic without live GNSS hardware.

ðŸ”§ Hardware Setup
	â€¢	Arduino Uno / Nano / Mega
	â€¢	Quectel L89HA GNSS Module
	â€¢	Wiring (SoftwareSerial pins):
	â€¢	Arduino Pin 4 â†’ GNSS TX
	â€¢	Arduino Pin 3 â†’ GNSS RX

ðŸš€ Flight State Machine Logic
	â€¢	IDLE â†’ ASCENT: When altitude > 1 m.
	â€¢	ASCENT â†’ APOGEE: When altitude stops increasing and starts decreasing.
	â€¢	APOGEE â†’ DESCENT: Transition immediately after peak altitude.
	â€¢	DESCENT â†’ PAYLOAD DEPLOYED: When descending and altitude â‰¤ 75% of peak altitude.
	â€¢	DESCENT / PAYLOAD DEPLOYED â†’ LANDED: When altitude â‰¤ 5 m.
